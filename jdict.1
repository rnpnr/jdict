.Sh CAVEATS
Many of the newer dictionaries available online contain full json
data. This throws away the benefits of the original yomidict
format and requires a full json parser to handle. This is outside
the scope of this utility and will not be implemented. To check if
the dictionary is supported open a term_bank_XX.json file and check
for field names. If they are present the dictionary is not
supported.
